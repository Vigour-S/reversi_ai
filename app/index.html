            <h2>What is reversi game?</h2>
            <p>
                Reversi (A.K.A Othello) is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board.
                During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.
                The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled. For more info, refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi" target="_blank">wiki</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How this was implemented?</h2>
            <p>
                This game was based on minimax and alpha-beta-pruning algorithm, implemented with Javascript and Python.
                It searches every possible square you tent to place a disk. The search depth actually affects the difficulty of the game. At the bottom of the search tree, we use a evalution function to find the best result we can get. However, right now this AI does not have too much self-learning ability. I am trying to make it smarter.
                For more implementation details, refer to <a href="https://github.com/Vigour-S/reversi_ai" target="_blank">Github</a>.
